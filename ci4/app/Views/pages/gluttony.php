<p id="htext">For the third layer, I shall present the ultimate, "culminated" form of my interests: Music.</p>
<p id="htext">I believe music is the greatest form of figuring out one's interests.</p>
<p id="htext">So, here. an entire playlist songs I'd vote with full confidence are 10/10.</p>
<p id="high">Go on. Spin the wheel. Listen in.</p>
<br>
<p id="note"><i>Note 1: There is plenty of great music in the world. This playlist only consists of great music I could only care to remember. There's going to be tracks that should be here but aren't.<br>Note 2: Because Spotify is big stoopid, you can't control the player to the fullest extent in an embed. I recommend going onto Spotify in order to listen with shuffle, which is the greater intended experience. Try it yourself.</i></p>
