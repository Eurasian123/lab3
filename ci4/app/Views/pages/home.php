<h1>Vaporeon Copypasta</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16px">Hey guys, did you know that in terms of █████████████████████ [DATA EXPUNGED], Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the █████████ group, which is mostly comprised of ███████, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able to [DATA EXPUNGED], and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can [REDACTED]. Due to their mostly █████ based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that ███████████████████ would be [REDACTED], ██████ that you could easily [DATA EXPUNGED] for hours without ████████████. They can also learn the moves Attract, ██████████████, █████████, █████, and Tail Whip, along with not having [REDACTED], so it’d be incredibly easy for one to [DATA EXPUNGED]. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily [REDACTED] with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of [REDACTED]. Also, fun fact, if you [DATA EXPUNGED], you can make your Vaporeon [REDACTED]. Vaporeon is literally built for ██████████. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can [DATA EXPUNGED], ████████████████████ and still [DATA EXPUNGED].<p>
