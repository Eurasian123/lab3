<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>This is very much what I do most of the time nowadays. I love a good story, so why not make a good story myself? While it started out supplementary to roleplays, I made it my main gig in order to satisfy my own desire to see the worlds I make grow and to put all the little fun scenarios in my head into word.<br>While I won't put my <i>whole</i> résumé here, I'd like to note a few achievements of mine:<br>First is <a href="https://genshin-impact-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Hedmaya">Hedmaya</a>, a Genshin Impact Alternate Universe where a second continent exists beyond Teyvat. Most of my writing effort during college went into this project, and is pretty much my current magnum opus. Though, <a href="https://genshin-impact-fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Eurasian%27s_Works">i've definitely worked on other Genshin-related writing stuff</a>.<br>Second is the Backrooms' <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-80">Level 80</a>, a simple desert road. While I haven't been much active when it comes to Backrooms content nowadays, it is definitely one of my proudest works simply because it got published.</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>While it is not something I usually indulge in, I sometimes get a strike of inspiration, and open up my local art application or a sketchbook, and begin making something I want drawn. I'm not the best artist, but I have certain skills that make me passable.<br>Though, my best use of art skills is most seen vexillologically&mdash; I have plenty of experience in making a good flag.</p>

<h2>Coding / Editing</h2>
<p>Originally, this section was reserved for music. Unfortunately, I rarely ever make music, so I instead put here what I do more commonly&mdash; computer stuff!<br>I frequently edit stuff together, whether its image editing, video editing, or whatnot; it's very adjacent to content creation while not being content creation itself. It is less a "hobby" and more a "useful skill" that I find myself frequently applying while chatting away on the internet.<br>I also code in order to do what I want while writing. I've written scripts in order to simulate elections, charted tables that reference <i>foreign site data</i> for a roleplay, and <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:infinity">made a revolutionary theme on a Wikidot</a> for a group I haven't published an article of.<br>Needless to say, it's a living. :)<p>
